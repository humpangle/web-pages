There was Snowflock growing on green leaves inside Toolbox somewhere in the corner of Hell.
Christopher Ikiebe started running around Flock+hell. He is being chased by Patrick Obayagbon.
Patrick uses Ada to kill Chris and carries Chris to Collin Jost.
Jost ties dead Christ with Bow and ties Bow around neck of Fat Sumo.
While Fat was dragging Chris, Chris wakes up, but he was supposed to be Dead??? So Fat hits him severally with
Floppy+Disc each time flinging Disc at TreeLogic who bounces each Disc off her Boots.
Tree breaks Boot foot on Horn and now comes Doctor Dolphin with its Fan.

Dolphin pushes Horn into Fan Blades crushes Horn with Kraka sound - bones and blood spraying unto Sammy.

Sammy absorbs bones and blood into Colon - pierces Colon with Anchor - sprays absorbed blood Bones unto Nails.
He gathers Nails into Basin. And uses Nails in Basin to manufactures Cuff-links.

Links fly into Janet Yellen's Hair - she uses Locks to pull them out. That wwouldn't help so she hit her head on stack
of Books. But she read in Book that AlSharpton could help with Peas to pick links off her hair.
